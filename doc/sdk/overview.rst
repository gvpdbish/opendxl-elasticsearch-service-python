Overview
========

The Elasticsearch DXL Python service exposes access to the
`Elasticsearch REST APIs <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html>`_
via the `Data Exchange Layer <http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx>`_
(DXL) fabric. The service also provides support for storing event notifications
received from the DXL fabric to Elasticsearch.
